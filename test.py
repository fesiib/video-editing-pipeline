what is it a there it is a 4415\", \" a 4415 why processor four gigs or eight gigs of ram\", \" it's got 64 gigs or 128 gigs of storage acclaimed nine\", \" hours of battery life well this one's\", \" got a a very tablet-like form factor so all those specs are actually\", \" 1.7 most of the time whereas this one has a base clock of 1.6\", \" yet but this also comes with four or eight gigs of ram and i think it starts at 128 gigs of storage\", \" so the pricing for that is about 600 and then the pricing for a surface\", \" with the eight gig rams back and 128 gigs of storage is about\", \" 549. so the question becomes would you rather something\", \" or would you prefer something that's similar in spec but that will fit\", \" in your pocket because that's their whole that's their whole jam with this thing\", \" then yeah that's that's pretty\", \" much it i do want to check out the webcam because apparently this machine has windows\", \" hello facial recognition for sign in which is a fantastic feature\", \" actually it's speakers\", \" stereo speakers looks like it's nice to have this has only a single speaker that's coming from kind of\", \" under the keyboard here somewhere\", \" wow that was great timing actually very nice so\", \" okay the magnetic docking mechanism feels wow that's nice\", \" just as strong as we've come to expect from a surface device it's really easy to\", \" pop on there not a single time has it managed to be misaligned so that's great\", \" really nice to see now we can go ahead and\", \" okay so the surface connect finally has an adapter now that you can buy you can get\", \" a little a little hub that turns this connector it's like this really bulky thing though\", \" into a single usb 3.1 type c so that's\", \" one option or my understanding is that this type c adapter will work and i've got a couple of\", \" type c dongles ready so i can try those out\", \" as you can expect\", \" as you would expect for 400 bucks even though you're getting a machine with surprising\", \" build quality you're not getting much in terms of in fact that's all there was\", \" so this is the signature\", \" type cover let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open assuming that i can figure\", \" they're going to be able to see it with our high quality\", \" so as you can expect\", \" as you would expect for 400 bucks even though you're

boy open assuming that i can figure\", \" actually this is a good opportunity\", \" for us to check out i o so the usbc that i mentioned before we've got a three and a half millimeter headphone jack\", \" we've got this dock that requires unfortunately a bulky not to mention 80\", \" adapter in order to turn it into anything other than charging for this if you wanted to just\", \" turn it into another type c port though i'm very grateful microsoft included this one wish it was thunderbolt\", \" but again this is a 400 to 550 machine so we can't be we\", \" can't get too greedy we've

gives you a very reasonable amount\", \" of storage expansion\", \" i mean just to put it in context here's sort of a more typical\", \" uh ultrabook so this is a blade stealth let's put this on top

wasn't sure if we were going to do a full review of this thing but i'm actually\", \" getting to the point now where i am i am pretty impressed with it and i'd love to hear from\", \" you guys in the
